Ever struggled to figure out what album you want to play?  Associating music with names isn't always as easy as associating it with a picture, so try out this plugin and see if it makes music browsing more fun.

Developed as an alternative to the ever popular, but IMHO sucky Cover Flow method, which gives you abosolutely no overview of your music whatsoever.

Get to know your album-art - somebody spent ages putting it together ;-)
